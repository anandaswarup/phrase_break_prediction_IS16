It NB 
would NB 
be NB 
too NB 
ridiculous B 
for NB 
me NB 
to NB 
attempt NB 
anything B 
where NB 
I NB 
am NB 
now B 
with NB 
my NB 
little NB 
half NB 
acre BB 
It NB 
would NB 
be NB 
quite NB 
a NB 
burlesque BB 
But NB 
if NB 
I NB 
had NB 
more NB 
room B 
I NB 
should NB 
take NB 
a NB 
prodigious NB 
delight NB 
in NB 
improving B 
and NB 
planting BB 
We NB 
did NB 
a NB 
vast NB 
deal B 
in NB 
that NB 
way NB 
at NB 
the NB 
Parsonage B 
we NB 
made NB 
it NB 
quite NB 
a NB 
different NB 
place B 
from NB 
what NB 
it NB 
was NB 
when NB 
we B 
first NB 
had NB 
it BB 
You NB 
young NB 
ones B 
do NB 
not NB 
remember NB 
much NB 
about NB 
it B 
perhaps B 
but NB 
if NB 
dear NB 
Sir NB 
Thomas NB 
were NB 
here B 
he NB 
could NB 
tell NB 
you NB 
what B 
improvements NB 
we NB 
made B 
and NB 
a NB 
great NB 
deal NB 
more B 
would NB 
have NB 
been NB 
done B 
but NB 
for NB 
poor NB 
Mister B 
Norriss NB 
sad NB
