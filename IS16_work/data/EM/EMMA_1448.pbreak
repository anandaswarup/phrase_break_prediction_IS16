I NB 
was NB 
mad NB 
enough NB 
however B 
to NB 
resent BB 
I NB 
doubted NB 
her NB 
affection BB 
I NB 
doubted NB 
it NB 
more NB 
the NB 
next NB 
day B 
on NB 
Box NB 
Hill B 
when B 
provoked NB 
by NB 
such NB 
conduct B 
on NB 
my NB 
side B 
such NB 
shameful B 
insolent NB 
neglect NB 
of NB 
her B 
and NB 
such NB 
apparent NB 
devotion NB 
to NB 
Miss NB 
W B 
as NB 
it NB 
would NB 
have NB 
been NB 
impossible B 
for NB 
any NB 
woman NB 
of NB 
sense B 
to NB 
endure B 
she NB 
spoke NB 
her NB 
resentment B 
in NB 
a NB 
form NB

to NB 
me BB 
In NB 
short B 
my NB 
dear NB 
madam B 
it NB 
was NB 
a NB 
quarrel NB 
blameless B 
on NB 
her NB 
side B 
abominable NB 
on NB 
mine B 
and NB 
I NB 
returned NB 
the NB

evening NB 
to NB 
Richmond B 
though NB 
I NB 
might NB 
have NB 
staid NB 
with NB 
you B 
till NB 
the NB 
next NB 
morning B 
merely NB 
because NB 
I NB 
would NB 
be NB

angry B 
with NB 
her NB
