A NB 
very NB 
successful NB 
visit B 
I NB 
saw NB 
all NB 
the NB 
three NB 
ladies B 
and NB 
felt NB 
very NB 
much NB 
obliged NB 
to NB 
you NB 
for NB 
your NB 
preparatory NB 
hint BB 
If NB 
the NB 
talking NB 
aunt B 
had NB 
taken NB 
me NB 
quite NB 
by NB 
surprize B 
it NB 
must NB 
have NB 
been NB 
the NB 
death NB 
of NB 
me BB 
As NB 
it NB 
was B 
I NB 
was NB 
only NB 
betrayed B 
into NB 
paying NB 
a NB 
most NB 
unreasonable NB 
visit BB 
Ten NB 
minutes B 
would NB 
have NB 
been NB 
all NB 
that NB 
was NB 
necessary B 
perhaps NB 
all NB 
that NB 
was NB 
proper B 
and NB 
I NB 
had NB 
told NB 
my NB 
father NB 
I B 
should NB 
certainly NB 
be NB 
at NB 
home NB 
before NB 
him B 
but NB 
there NB 
was NB 
no NB 
getting NB 
away B 
no NB 
pause B 
and NB 
to NB 
my NB 
utter NB 
astonishment B 
I NB 
found B 
when NB 
he B 
finding NB 
me NB 
nowhere NB 
else B 
joined NB 
me NB 
there NB 
at NB 
last B 
that NB 
I NB 
had NB 
been NB 
actually NB 
sitting B 
with NB 
them NB 
very NB 
nearly B 
three NB 
quarters NB 
of NB 
an NB 
hour BB
