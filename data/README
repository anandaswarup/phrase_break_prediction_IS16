The data consists of the following features extracted for each utterance (from Festival utterance structure): 
    1. word 
    2. break associated with that word (generated from acoustics)

The correspondence of breaks with TOBI break levels
    1. NB (non-break) -> TOBI level 1
    2. B (break) -> TOBI level 3 and 4 (Actually TOBI level 4 corresponds to BB, but in our data B and BB have been collapsed together)

Note : Festival phrasing rules do not include TOBI level 2

The data is available for the following languages:
    1. English : (Audiobook data)
        a. EMMA by Jane Austen 
        b. Mansfield Park by Jane Austen
